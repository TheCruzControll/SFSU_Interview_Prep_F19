# Welcome to SFSU Interview Prep Sessions, 2019

Heyo! I'm Sean, I'm a computer science student at San Francisco State University graduating this December heading to Lyft for a full-time Software Engineer position in Seattle. I came from a community college background and learned how incredibly difficult the recruiting process is for us, fortunately, earlier than most. I started doing interview prep in my sophomore year and after 3 years I've learned a few tricks that I hope to share to other students who are in similar situations that I was in before. I hope you take this course seriously as it is unpaid, uncredited and solely because I want to empower and elevate the computer science community as SFSU. 


# Structure
You'll notice that each of you have a directory with your first name in the repo. This will  hold all of your resources and submissions for assignments due. Each of your directories will have a `README` file for you to fill out before our first session on 9/9/2019. 

There is another directory titled `code_prompts`, which will hold all of the assignment prompts for this semester. These will be labeled by week. 

If you were not part of the original group for the students, but you would like to follow along with the course, feel free to clone the repo and add a directory with your name and email/slack me so I'm notified.
